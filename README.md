## Project Details

- **Organization:** Fortran-Lang
- **Project:** [High-level HTTP client library](https://github.com/fortran-lang/http-client)
- **Mentors:** Milan Curcic, Arteev Raina, Philipp Engel
- **Contributor:** Rajkumar Dongre

This report summarizes the work done as part of my `GSoC 2023` project titled `High-level HTTP client library` at [**`fortran-lang/http-client`**](https://github.com/fortran-lang/http-client).

## Abstract:
The primary focus of this project was to connect the world of Fortran programming with the realm of HTTP communication. Through the creation of a high-level HTTP request library, the project aimed to equip Fortran programmers with a user-friendly toolkit for seamlessly executing standard HTTP requests. This encompassed an array of request methods, notably including popular choices such as `GET`, `HEAD`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`. The project's intent was to facilitate smooth integration of HTTP interactions into Fortran applications, simplifying the traditionally complex process and promoting enhanced connectivity between Fortran and web services.

## Project Overview

The project's primary objective was to create a high-level library for HTTP requests that caters specifically to the Fortran programming language. To achieve this, the project utilized the existing [fortran-curl](https://github.com/interkosmos/fortran-curl) library, which provides Fortran bindings to the powerful [libcurl](https://curl.se/) libraryâ€”a widely adopted tool for handling HTTP requests.

The overarching goals of the project included:

1. **HTTP Request Abstraction:** Develop a user-friendly interface that abstracts the complexities of forming HTTP requests. This abstraction aimed to shield Fortran developers from the intricacies of crafting HTTP headers, managing timeouts, and dealing with various HTTP response codes.

2. **Support for Common HTTP Methods:** Implement functions within the library that correspond to standard HTTP methods. Each function was designed to accept relevant parameters and payload data where applicable, providing a cohesive way to initiate various types of requests.

3. **Response Handling and Parsing:** Create mechanisms to retrieve and parse data from the response body and headers. This functionality would enable Fortran programmers to efficiently extract and process valuable information from HTTP responses.

4. **Integration with "fortran-curl":** Leverage the existing "fortran-curl" library to establish the underlying connection and communication with web services. This integration was pivotal in harnessing the power of the battle-tested "libcurl" library and extending its capabilities to the Fortran domain.

5. **Ease of Use:** Prioritize user experience by designing the library with simplicity and usability in mind. The aim was to lower the barrier of entry for Fortran developers who may have limited prior experience with web interactions.

6. **Test Cases and Quality Assurance:** Implement a comprehensive suite of test cases to ensure the robustness and reliability of the library's functionalities. Test cases were crafted to cover a range of scenarios, including different HTTP methods, response codes, payload types, and edge cases. The integration of automated testing aimed to identify and rectify potential issues early in the development process.

7. **Documentation and Examples:** Create comprehensive documentation and examples that guide developers through the process of incorporating the library into their Fortran projects. This facet aimed to empower developers to quickly grasp the library's functionality and integrate it effectively.

## Progress and Accomplishments

Throughout the Google Summer of Code 2023 program, significant strides were made in achieving the core goals of the project. The following sections highlight the major accomplishments, technical advancements, and features that were successfully implemented.

**Features of the Library:**

The developed high-level HTTP library for Fortran boasts a range of features designed to empower developers in making seamless HTTP requests and interacting with web services. These features include:

1. **Sending HTTP Requests:**
   - **GET:** Retrieve data from the server.
   - **POST:** Submit data to be processed by the server.
   - **PUT:** Replace or create resources on the server.
   - **DELETE:** Remove resources from the server.
   - **PATCH:** Perform partial updates to resources.
   - **HEAD:** Retrieve response headers without the response content.

2. **Data Support:**
   - The library accommodates the sending of various data types with requests, supporting file uploads and form data.

3. **Response Handling:**
   - Developers can retrieve response content effortlessly.
   - The HTTP status code returned by the server can be obtained for proper status handling.
   - The length of the response content can be fetched to manage data streams effectively.
   - Access to response headers facilitates the extraction of crucial information.

4. **Custom Headers:**
   - Developers can include custom headers in requests to the server, enhancing flexibility in interactions.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Unsuccessful requests are detected and handled gracefully, accompanied by informative error messages that aid in debugging.

6. **Request Timeout:**
   - A crucial enhancement for responsiveness, the ability to set a maximum time allowed for request completion was implemented.

7. **Authentication:**
   - Standard authentication methods are supported, allowing requests to protected resources with appropriate authentication credentials.

**Accomplishments:**

- **HTTP Methods Implementation:** All standard HTTP request methods were successfully implemented within the library, enabling developers to seamlessly interact with web services using a familiar syntax.

- **Response Parsing:** Mechanisms for parsing data from both response bodies and headers were developed, providing developers with the ability to extract and process essential information from server responses.

- **Automated Testing:** A comprehensive suite of automated tests was established to ensure the library's functionalities were robust and reliable. These tests covered diverse scenarios, including various HTTP methods, response codes, payload types, and edge cases.

- **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation was created, including usage guides, examples, and API references. This documentation empowers developers to quickly grasp and integrate the library into their projects.

- **Integration with "fortran-curl":** The seamless integration of the library with the "fortran-curl" bindings to "libcurl" ensured efficient underlying communication with web services.

- **Usability Enhancement:** By abstracting the complexities of low-level HTTP interactions, the library significantly improved the accessibility of web services for Fortran programmers, simplifying their development process.

## Learning and Skill Development

Participation in the Google Summer of Code 2023 provided a rich and immersive learning experience, fostering the acquisition of valuable skills and knowledge in various domains. The journey encompassed not only the project's technical aspects but also the broader ecosystem of software development and collaboration. The following areas outline the key learning points during the program:
